## Complete Calculation Flow

### 1. Base Service Calculation
```
Main Service Hours = max(totalRooms × timePerRoom, minTime)
Main Service Cost = Main Service Hours × Hourly Rate

Where:
- totalRooms = bedrooms + bathrooms
- timePerRoom: general=0.8h, deep=1.2h, move=1.5h
- minTime: general=1.5h, deep=2.0h, move=2.5h
```

### 2. Add-on Services
```
Add-on Cost = Σ(addon hours × hourly rate)
Custom Add-on Cost = Σ(custom addon prices)
```

### 3. Pre-Multiplier Subtotal
```
Pre-Multiplier Subtotal = Main Service Cost + Add-on Cost + Custom Add-on Cost
```

### 4. Postcode Multiplier Application
```
Applied Multiplier = suburbMultiplier (if provided) OR suggested multiplier from postcode data
Pre-Multiplier Subtotal = Main Service Cost + Add-on Cost + Custom Add-on Cost
Adjusted Subtotal = Pre-Multiplier Subtotal × Applied Multiplier
Postcode Adjustment = (Applied Multiplier - 1) × Pre-Multiplier Subtotal
```

### 5. Discount Application
```
If discountApplied = true:
  If discountAmount > 0:
    Final Discount = min(discountAmount, adjustedSubtotal)
  Else:
    Final Discount = adjustedSubtotal × (discountPercentage / 100)
Else:
  Final Discount = 0
```

### 6. Net Revenue
```
Net Revenue = Adjusted Subtotal - Final Discount
```

### 7. Tax and Total
```
GST = Net Revenue × 10%
Total = Net Revenue + GST
```

### 8. Labor and Profit Calculations
```
Total Hours = Main Service Hours + Σ(addon hours)
Cleaner Pay = Total Hours × Cleaner Rate
Profit = Net Revenue - Cleaner Pay
Margin = (Profit / Net Revenue) × 100
```

### 9. Deposit
```
Deposit Amount = Total × (depositPercentage / 100)
Remaining Balance = Total - Deposit Amount
```

## Example Calculation

### Input Parameters
- Service: General Clean
- Bedrooms: 2, Bathrooms: 1
- Add-ons: Inside Oven Clean (0.75h), Carpet Steam Clean (1.0h)
- Custom Add-ons: Window Cleaning ($80)
- Hourly Rate: $60, Cleaner Rate: $35
- Postcode: 2060 (Waverton, multiplier: 1.15)
- Discount: 10% percentage discount
- Deposit: 50%

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Base Service**
   - Total Rooms = 2 + 1 = 3
   - Time Per Room = 0.8h (general)
   - Main Service Hours = max(3 × 0.8, 1.5) = max(2.4, 1.5) = 2.4h
   - Main Service Cost = 2.4h × $60 = $144.00

2. **Add-ons**
   - Inside Oven Clean: 0.75h × $60 = $45.00
   - Carpet Steam Clean: 1.0h × $60 = $60.00
   - Add-on Cost = $45 + $60 = $105.00

3. **Custom Add-ons**
   - Window Cleaning: $80.00

4. **Pre-Multiplier Subtotal**
   - Pre-Multiplier Subtotal = $144 + $105 + $80 = $329.00

5. **Postcode Adjustment**
   - Applied Multiplier = 1.15 (Waverton)
   - Adjusted Subtotal = $329 × 1.15 = $378.35
   - Postcode Adjustment = (1.15 - 1) × $329 = $49.35

6. **Discount**
   - Final Discount = $378.35 × 10% = $37.84

7. **Net Revenue**
   - Net Revenue = $378.35 - $37.84 = $340.51

8. **Tax and Total**
   - GST = $340.51 × 10% = $34.05
   - Total = $340.51 + $34.05 = $374.56

9. **Labor and Profit**
   - Total Hours = 2.4 + 0.75 + 1.0 = 4.15h
   - Cleaner Pay = 4.15h × $35 = $145.25
   - Profit = $340.51 - $145.25 = $195.26
   - Margin = ($195.26 / $340.51) × 100 = 57.34%

10. **Deposit**
    - Deposit Amount = $374.56 × 50% = $187.28
    - Remaining Balance = $374.56 - $187.28 = $187.28
